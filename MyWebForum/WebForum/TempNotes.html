Always check the "Task List" for leftover "TODO"-s !
-----------------------------------------------------
T.p.10~13 : made the latest 10 (of all types of) threads listed on the "Home > Index" page.
	Here, only the "Boards" should be listed, if not something else, but generally it is.
	Ideally the "Home > Index" should not hold any forum entries, but introduction to the site.
	See "site map.txt" for a general site layout and to see what links should lead to what pages & data to be shown to what User types /roles.
