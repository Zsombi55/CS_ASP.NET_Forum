Always check the "Task List" for leftover "TODO"-s !
-----------------------------------------------------
T.p.10~13 : made the latest 10 (of all types of) threads listed on the "Home > Index" page.
	Here, only the "Boards" should be listed, if not something else, but generally it is.
	Ideally the "Home > Index" should not hold any forum entries, but introduction to the site.
	See "site map.txt" for a general site layout and to see what links should lead to what pages & data to be shown to what User types /roles.

Rename the Controllers from singular to plural - ForumController >> ForumsController - so that the address paths for showing lists will be called appropriately, eg.: instead of
	https://localhost:44323/Forum/Forum/1 it will be https://localhost:44323/Forums/Forum/1
	when loking at a specific "Forum". Take care to change the references in other files too.
